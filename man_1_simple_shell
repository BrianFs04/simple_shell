.SH DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
The Holberton shell is capable of executing basic operations in interactive and non interactive mode. It uses
.B execve()
function to execute a command coming from standard input
which is tokenized using
.B strtok()
to discriminate command, arguments and path. A child process is created using
.AR fork()
to do the execve function as a subprocess. Given that a special command is entered, the shell will exit
whit a specific status.

.B Basic Features

-Displays a prompt and wait for the user to type a command.

-A command line always ends with a new line.

-The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.

-The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.

-If an executable cannot be found, prints an error message and display the prompt again.
